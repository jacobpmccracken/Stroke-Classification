# Stroke-Classification
Final Advanced Analytics Project

This project was part of the Advanced Analytics course at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I worked in a team with 3 other students in an open ended project where we applied the materials we learned in class to a dataset of our own choosing. We picked a dataset that classified if a patient had a stoke, based on a number of different variables such as age, gender, smoking status, marriage status, job history, BMI, and average glucose level. Severl methods were used to classify the response variable and then the best was selected and presented in class. These methods included logistic regression, decision trees, and K-nearest neighbors.
